#intro to python

I learnt about connecting anaconda and creating a virtual environment (venv):

C:\Users\laptop\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
cd C:\Users\Laptop\Desktop\sigh\DA\Krish naik bootcamp
code .
conda create -p venv python==3.12

i also learnt that in order to open an ipynb file in vscode i need to connect the kernel to ipykernel, i do this by clicking on "detecting kernel" on the top of the ipynb and then clicking on the venv just created. this would prompt you to install ipykernel, and in order to do that we run:
"pip install ipykernel"
it is also considered a good practice to add in all these requirements in a file "requirements.txt"
now it is ready for typing and running code.

I brushed up on basic concepts that i had learnt in the very initial classes of python.

i recapped variables, case sensitivity, how indents replace curly braces in python, how single line comments use a hash (#) and milti line comments use 3 quotes ('''), how to print the type of the variable (print(type())), and the concept of "type inference" which compliments the dynamic typing of python. I also recapped "name errors"  which arise upon the usage of incorrect variables (uninitialized, or wrong case). I learnt about how to type a long line of code in python in multiple lines to support readability, and also its contradiction, that is how we can type multiple lines of code in one single line.
